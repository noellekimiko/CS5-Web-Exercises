<a name="text"></a><h2><a name="Lab_9_Flashcards_with_Public_Com"></a> Lab 9: Flashcards with Public Comments </h2>
   In this lab, we will be using more JQuery and an SQL database to expand upon the picture flashcards we built in Lab 8. 
<p />
   The starter files are available here. You should have <a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~cs5grad/cs5/webStarterFiles/lab9starterfiles/sql.py" target="_top">sql.py</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~cs5grad/cs5/webStarterFiles/lab9starterfiles/comment.py" target="_top">comment.py</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~cs5grad/cs5/webStarterFiles/lab9starterfiles/flashcards9.html" target="_top">flashcards9.html</a>. You can use the same picture uploading interface (index8.html and flashcards8.py) with very few modifications.
<p />
   To implement the comment system, we are using Python's built-in database, SQLite3, whose documentation is available <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sqlite3.html" target="_top">here</a>. 
<p />
<h3><a name="Sample_Interface"></a> Sample Interface </h3>

<font color="gray">The biggest changes: our interface had buttons for cycling forward and backward through the pictures- we no longer have a random flashcard appear. 
We added  the comment text box, as well as a button for toggling the submitted comments. </font></center>
<p />
<h3><a name="A_Short_Introduction_to_SQLite3"></a> A Short Introduction to SQLite3 </h3>
<p />
SQLite is Python's built-in database: it allows you to store information in a table. Create a file in your cgi-bin named sql.py. Copy and paste the following code into the top of your file:
<p />
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/python
import sqlite3
</pre> 
<p />
The first line of code is Python's location (we went over this in Lab 7/8), and the second line imports SQLite3, which is built in to Python.
<p />
You also need to establish a connection to a SQL database.
<pre>
conn&#61;sqlite3.connect(&#39;sqldatabase.sql&#39;)
c &#61; conn.cursor()
</pre>
<p />
This code will create a file named 'sqldatabase.sql'. The second line create a cursor object, which is the main way that you will interact with your new database. You can think of your cursor in the same way as your mouse cursor: you can select table rows, and add or delete rows.
<p />
<h5><a name="Creating_A_Table"></a> Creating A Table </h5>
<p />
After your connection and cursor are established, you can create a table using SQLite. To do so, you will want your cursor to execute the create table command
<p />
<pre>
c.execute(&#34;create table people(name text, age text, occupation text);&#34;) 
</pre>
<p />
For every SQLite function you call, you must include <tt>c.execute</tt>. The table we created is named people, and it has three columns: person, age, and occupation. The <tt>text</tt> simply signifies that each parameter will be letters. For this assignment, we will only use text, so you don't have to worry about the other types (integer, real).
<p />
<p />
<h5><a name="Inserting_A_Row"></a> Inserting A Row </h5>
An empty table is boring. You can insert rows by executing the insert command:
<p />
<pre>
person&#61;(&#39;Albus Dumbledore&#39;, &#39;116&#39;, &#39;Wizard&#39;)

c.execute(&#34;insert into people values(?,?,?)&#34;, person )
</pre>
<p />
The first thing to notice here is the list of question marks in the insert command. They tell SQLite that a value is included in person, the second argument. <tt>person</tt> is defined above, and it must be a tuple (list).
<p />
<h5><a name="Saving_Changes"></a><a name="Saving_Changes_"></a> Saving Changes! </h5>
<p />
To make sure your changes save, you need to use the commit function on your table: 
<pre>conn.commit()
</pre>
Note that this should be placed <strong>after</strong> the lines where you make changes to your table.
<p />
<h5><a name="Selecting_Rows"></a> Selecting Rows </h5>
Selecting row/s from your people table is easy (after all, we only have one row)! You can select the entire table using select * : 
<p />
<pre>
c.execute(&#34;select &#42; from people&#34;)
</pre>
<p />
<h5><a name="Your_Table_The_Command_Line"></a> Your Table -&gt; The Command Line </h5>
   In order for your script to output the rows in the table you need to bind the command above to a variable, like x. Then, using a for loop, iterate over all of the rows in x, printing each row.
<p />
Now you can run your Python script through the command prompt / terminal. Open up your command line, and navigate to your web folder. If web is on your Desktop, then you will type <tt>cd Desktop/web</tt>. Then, type
<pre>
python cgi-bin/sql.py
</pre>
<p />
You should see
<pre>
(u&#39;Albus Dumbledore&#39;, u&#39;116&#39;, u&#39;Wizard&#39; )
</pre>
Small note: The u before the strings is merely Python's way of signifying unicode characters. You don't have to worry about it.
<p />
Now you will need to comment out the create table line, otherwise when you run your script again, it will create another table over the one you just saved.
You may want to add more people to your table- just change the <tt>person = </tt> line to whatever details you want and run sql.py again.
<p />
<p />
If you only want to select the names of your people, you could say
<pre>
c.execute(&#34;select name from people&#34;)
</pre>
Try inserting the following code where your <tt>select *</tt> function was earlier. Now you should see only the names of the people in your table,
<pre>
(u&#39;Adolf Hitler&#39;,) (u&#39;Albus Dumbledore,) (u&#39;Dora the Explorer&#39;,) (u&#39;Chuck Norris&#39;,)
</pre>
<p />
If you want to select the only names starting with 'A', (or any other letter of your choice), you can do so using the 'where' modifier:
<pre>
c.execute(&#34;select &#42; from people where name like &#39;A&#37;&#39; &#34;)
</pre>
<p />
You can also use 'where' if you want to pull out a specific entry:
<pre> 
c.execute(&#34;select &#42; from people where name&#61;?&#34;, (&#39;Albus Dumbledore&#39;,)) </pre>
<p />
A list of commonly used SQL commands is available at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_where.asp" target="_top">w3Schools</a>.
<p />
<h5><a name="Deleting_Your_Table"></a> Deleting Your Table </h5>
   If for any reason you need to delete your table, the delete command is
<pre>
c.execute(&#34;drop table people;&#34;)
</pre>
   Needless to say, you are waging utter unsalvageable destruction like the fiery hand of God on your table and cannot ever restore it again. If you do delete your table, you will need to uncomment your create table command to access SQLite again.
<p />
<p />
<p />
<h3><a name="Modifications"></a> Modifications </h3>
<p />
<h5><a name="sql_py"></a> sql.py </h5>
For your flashcards 9, you will need to modify sql.py in several ways. As always, make sure that the following is in your header:
<pre>
import cgi
import cgitb; cgitb.enable()</pre>
<p />
Like the previous incarnations of flashcards, we will want to collect data from cgi.FieldStorage(). In this case, you will want to get values for name, comment, and picNum. 
Then, you will need to put all of these into your table for comments. If you decide to display the time that a comment was posted, then you can grab the submit time using
<pre>
submitTime&#61;time.asctime(time.localtime(time.time()))
</pre> as long as you have imported time in your header, and place time in your table as well.
<p />
<h5><a name="comment_py"></a> comment.py </h5>
   The comment.py file receives the picture number from the javascript in flashcards9.html file. Your goal is to modify comment.py so that it pulls all of the comments that pertain to that picture out of your SQL database.
<p />
   First, you will need to insert code that connects to your sql database file and creates your cursor, very similar to the code included sql.py.
<p />
   Then, you cursor needs to pull out all comments that match the number taken from the cgi.FieldStorage().
<p />
   In the for loop, you need to add code that retrieves the name, time, and comment, as well as have if statements to catch if the name or comment fields are blank.
<p />
<h5><a name="flashcards9_html"></a> flashcards9.html </h5>
<p />
   You will have to create two functions, nextCard and prevCard, that cycle through your photos in order. When you get to the last photo, nextCard should wrap around and return the first photo. Similarly, if you are on the first photo, prevCard should return the last photo. 
These functions will be very similar to firstCard(). Hint: For nextCard(), we used a mod %.   
<p />
   If you want, you can also edit the CSS styling for your comments- the most conventional form is to put them in boxes, but feel free to think out of the box.
<p />
<h5><a name="index9_html"></a> index9.html </h5>
   If you are editing the index for Lab 8, the only thing you will need to change is the button link.
<p />
Now you're done!! Yay!! Don't forget to submit your work.
